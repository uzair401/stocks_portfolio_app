# Stocks Portfolio Management Web Application

## Description

Stocks Portfolio Management Web Application is a web application designed to help users manage their personal financial portfolio. Users can buy and sell stocks, view their financial history, check stock prices, and track their total net worth. The application uses a combination of Flask for the backend, Jinja for templating, and SQLite for data storage, making it lightweight and easy to deploy.

## Features

- **User Registration/Login**: Secure user authentication for tracking personalized portfolios.
- **Quote Stocks**: Users can search for real-time stock quotes using an external API.
- **Buy and Sell Stocks**: Users can buy shares of stock at current market prices and sell them when needed.
- **Transaction History**: A complete history of all transactions (buys and sells) is maintained for each user.
- **Portfolio Overview**: A dashboard where users can view the current state of their portfolio, including the stocks they own and their respective values.
- **Check Account Balance**: Users can keep track of their cash balance after transactions.
